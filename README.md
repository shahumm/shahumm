## **Greetings, Friend! 👋**

Sometimes, I have a remarkably strong urge to immerse myself in creative activities such as coding, illustrating, photography, animation, or just exploring the nearby hills in pursuit of exotic species.

However, the spontaneity of these urges and their remarkable therapeutic effects have left me yearning for their recurrence. As a result, I've been working on personal projects that keep my thought process aligned with my end goals.
